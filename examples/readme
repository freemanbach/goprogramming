Configure your GOLang installation location to include /opt/golang software location
then edit your .bashrc file to add GOLANG_HOME=/opt/golang then
Add export PATH=$PATH:$GOLANG_HOME/bin
Execute source .bashrc


now we can execute go the compiler from our konsole.
To build/compile GOLANG source code into native executible:
go build filename.go
TO build and run directly in a one step process:
go run filename.go

There are commands to clean off all the binary files:
go clean
